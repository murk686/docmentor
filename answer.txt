**Creative Collaboration**

Creative collaboration is the process of two or more people or organizations working together to complete a task or achieve a goal. This is different from traditional collaboration in that it focuses on the creation of new ideas and solutions.

Creative collaboration allows for the pooling of diverse skillsets and knowledge reserves to be harnessed together to set a comprehensive content strategy that is designed to achieve business goals. It is important for organizations that want to stay ahead of the competition.
